Protoaculous Bundler
====================

Bundles up the latest from prototypejs and scriptaculous into a single file.

Used to do it [manually](http://inderpreetsingh.com/2011/03/21/protoaculous-1-9-0-minified/), but I sometimes forget to update, so I'm putting this simple script out there.

## Pre-generated scripts
Check the [dist](dist/) directory.

## To Run

```sh generate.sh```
